# Static

Static is a hard fork of [Kamber](http://github.com/f/kamber), a crystal blogging server based on [Kemal](http://github.com/sdogruyol/kemal). While Kamber was a static blog server that did not generate assets, Static generates the static assets on startup. This allows it to be used as a development server and to compile the assets to be uploaded to production servers. Static also resolves many dependancy issues and API deprecations present in Kamber.


> Kamber was not a static blog generator, Static is!
